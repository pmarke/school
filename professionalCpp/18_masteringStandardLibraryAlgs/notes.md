lambda
--------
The compiler transforms any lambda expression into some kind of unnamed functor. The captured variables become data members of this functor. 
 [capture_block](parameters) mutable constexpr noexcept_specifier attributes -> return_type {body}

 by default all values captured are constant unless you use the specifier mutable. 


 C++17 adds support to more than 60 Standard Library algorithms for executing them in parallel to improve their performance. Examples include for_each(), all_of(), copy(), count_if(), find(), replace(), search(), sort(), transform(), and many more. Algorithms that support parallel execution have the option to accept a so-called execution policy as their first parameter.
