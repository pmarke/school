Two types of memory
+ stack 
+ heap 

Dynamic memory is allocated on the heap 

new:
- Allocates the memory on the heap and returns the object .
- will throw an exception if there is not enough memory on the heap.
    + new (nothrow) will not throw an exeption if there is not enough memory, instead it will return a nullptr.

malloc 
- only allocates the number of bytes

realloc 
- allocates a new block of memory of the new size, copy all the old data to the new location, and deletes the original block. 
- DONT USE!! user defined objects do not respond well to bitwise copying.
