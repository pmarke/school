If you implement operator == and operator < in your class, you get the other relational operators for free with these templates. YOu can make these available for your class
by simply adding #include <utility> and adding the following using statement: using namespace std::rel_ops.
    Note: Author recommends that you jut implement all relational operators for a class yourself instead of relying on std::rel_ops.

OPERATOR NEW AND DELETE

When you define an operator new with extra parameters, you should also define the corresponding operator delete 
with the same extra parameters. You cannot call this operator delete with extra parameters yourself, but it
will be called only when you use your operator new with extra parameters and the constructor of your object throws an exception.
